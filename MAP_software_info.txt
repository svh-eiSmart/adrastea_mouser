This MCU2.1 SDK is the formal release to provide both ALT1250 and ALT1255 example projects and peripheral drivers by the same package.

On ALT1255 platform, the following example projects and peripheral driver are NOT supported yet:
    - AwsConnector
    - MqttConnector
    - GpsConnector
    - SocketConnector
    - PwrMgmtAwsDemo
	
This version is with minor changes from previous MCU version MCU_02_01_00_00_05:
    - Version naming:
        Adapt the YWWDV format as MAP releases.

    - Example:
        LteConnector)
            Add PDCP discard timer usage.

        MqttConnector)
            Add "No-Auth" usage.

        PushWake)
            Evaluate FIFO operation of accelerometer.
	
        PwrMgmtAwsDemo)
            Configure default power mode from stop to standby.
        
    - Middleware:
        ALTCOM)
            Fix RSRQ range.
            Add PDCP discard timer in LTE C-API. 
            Support "No-Auth" mode in MQTT C-API.

        Sensor)
            Add new APIs to configure ODR, FIFIO mode and high pass filter.

    - Debug:
        Add stacktrace.py to reconstruct the backtrace from the coredump.
        Support thread-aware debugging in Eclipse.
        Add comments to linker scripts.

    - Resolve additional Coverity tickets.

    - Replace LGPL-2.1-or-later open source software with the alternative implementation.
